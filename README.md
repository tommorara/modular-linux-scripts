Got it — you want the README to look nice and **eye-catching in Markdown**, like something that says “this repo is cool” when someone opens it.
Here’s a polished **“wow” version**:

- **Portable** – just clone & add to your `PATH`.
- **Documented** – all scripts explained in `docs/`.
- **Linux-first** – designed for GNU/Linux environments.
- **Reusable** – share across machines without breaking things.

## ⚡ Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/morara-linux-toolbox.git

````

Add `bin/` to your PATH:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/morara-linux-toolbox/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

Run scripts directly from the `bin/` folder:

```bash

If you want, I can now **add shields.io badges** (like “Made for Linux”, “Bash”, “MIT License”) and maybe a **banner image** at the top so it looks like a pro open-source project.

Do you want me to make that flashy version next?
